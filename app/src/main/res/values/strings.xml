        This App will trigger a 1 second vibration each time an emergency action intent is received.
        The first button will configure the SCAN button to broadcast such an intent.\n
        The desired behavior is, that the button will broadcast the intent independent of the device\'s screen- and lock-state.\n
        The second button will trigger an emergency intent broadcast after 10 seconds, to test if the intent broadcast receiver is
        working correctly even when the screen is shut down.
